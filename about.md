## About

Hi, TODAY is going to be a beautiful day. Its nice to meet you. 

My name is Mercy Michael Ihemedo, and I am designing this Github website to apply for an IT course in Tech Experts Academy (TEA).

## Welcome To Mercy Michael's Github Application Page.

### Why design this page?

I am designing this website on GitHub to apply for Machine Learning/Data Science in Tech Expert Academy. It will be my utmost joy if my application will be approved by TEA.

### My Motivation

I have a desire to be in the IT industry, hence I want to pursue a course in TEA to make that dream become a reality.

### My Application

My name is **Mercy Michael Ihemedo**, I was born on 5th August 1990. I am single and I run my own business. I grew up loving computer technology so much that i want to build a career on it. I developed the interest from watching movies about tech gurus and everything technology. I love everything technology, its very fascinating!

I like brainstorming ideas and finding solutions to problems. Somehow I got that skills from my teenage years because I am the first child of my parents and I took up responsibility of providing and assisting my parents with my younger ones very earlier in life. 

Most of these Technology courses costs an arm and a leg so I was not buoyant enough to go for it much earlier in life. I wanted to start somewhere that can help me learn while still making a living, that was how i started learning how to create websites with WordPress. I did more of self learning online. That was how i was able to start my own business. 

> -What I do is, 
> - source for product,
> - import,
> - create sales pages of the product and
> - promote it on social media.

Unfortunately I have not been able to fulfill that dream yet because my life has been a whole lots of ups and downs. But I have not given up on that. Life has not really been an easy journey for me but I am grateful.

I was happy and so excited when a friend told me about Tech Expert Academy (TEA) and linked me up to your website. That is why I'm here to apply to TEA and positively hoping to be one of the approved candidates for trainings. **I want to gain a skill in the constant exciting world of technology, especially in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence/ Data Science and I know TEA will help my dream skill to become a reality**. I really wish and hope I will meet your criteria for selection. 

The most important thing for me is to enjoy my work and technology is that ideal goal for me. I can't wait to jump right into it, only if you approve my application.

> ***Personally, I learn very fast and I like brainstorming ideas.***

I truly hope and wish you can help me actualize this dream of becoming part of the IT industry. I truly love to be part of it. I hope my application will be favorably considered.

Thank you in advance of your approval sir/ma.
