## About

Hi, TODAY is going to be a beautiful day. Its nice to meet you. 

My name is Mercy Michael Ihemedo, and I am designing this Github website to apply for a course on Machine Learning/Data Science in Tech Experts Academy

## Welcome To Mercy Michael's Github Application Page.

### Why 

I am designing this website on GitHub to apply for Machine Learning/Data Science in Tech Expert Academy. I hope my application for Machine Learning will be approved by TEA, that would be my utmost desire.

### What

I have a desire to be in the IT industry, hence I want to pursue a course in TEA (Tech Expert Academy) to make that dream become a reality for me.

### My Application

My name is **Mercy Michael Ihemedo**, I was born on 5th August 1990. I am single and I run my own business. I grew up loving computer technology so much that i want to build a career on it. I developed the interest from watching movies about tech gurus and everything technology. I love anything software, cyber security, its fascinating!

I like brainstorming ideas and finding solutions somehow i got that skills from my teenage years because I'm the first daughter and I took up responsibility of providing and assisting my parents with my younger ones very earlier in life.

Most of the courses costs an arm and a leg so i was not buoyant to go for it. I wanted to start somewhere that can help me learn while still making a living, that was how i started learning how to create websites with WordPress. I did more of self learning online. That was how i was able to start my own business. I source for product, import, create sales pages and promote on social media.

Unfortunately I have not been able to fulfill that dream yet because my life has been a whole lots of ups and downs. But i have not given up on that. It has not really been an easy journey but I am grateful.

I was intrigued and so excited when a friend told me about Tech Expert Academy (TEA) and linked me up to your website. I want to gain a skill in the constant exciting world of technology, especially in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence/ Data Science and I know TEA will help me realize that skill and dream. I really wish and hope I will meet your criteria for selection. 

The most important thing for me is to enjoy my work and technology is that ideal goal for me. I can't wait to jump right into it, only if you approve my application.

> ***Personally, I learn very fast and I like brainstorming ideas.***

I truly hope and wish you can help me actualize this dream of becoming part of the IT industry. I truly love to be part of it. I hope my application will be favorably considered.

Thank you in advance sir/ma.
