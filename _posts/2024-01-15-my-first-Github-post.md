I created a GitHub account
I forked a repository from https://github.com/datamaunz
I renamed the forked repository mercy-michael.github.io
I edited the files as described in the README.md
Now I am writing my first post by following the advice that I got from the README file
I hope to get admitted to be trained by Tech Expert Academy
